# GitHub Pages Setup Instructions

## ðŸ“š How to Enable GitHub Pages for Client Preview

Follow these steps to make your Epsilon Academy project available as a live preview:

### 1. Push Your Code to GitHub
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Setup GitHub Pages deployment"
git push origin main
```

### 2. Enable GitHub Pages in Repository Settings

1. Go to your GitHub repository: `https://github.com/Fading-Citizen/Epsilon-React`
2. Click on **Settings** (in the repository tabs)
3. Scroll down to **Pages** in the left sidebar
4. Under **Source**, select **"GitHub Actions"**
5. The deployment will automatically start when you push to main

### 3. Access Your Live Preview

Once deployed, your application will be available at:
**https://fading-citizen.github.io/Epsilon-React/**

### 4. Automatic Deployment

Every time you push changes to the `main` branch:
- GitHub Actions will automatically build the project
- Deploy it to GitHub Pages
- Your live preview will be updated within 2-3 minutes

### 5. Manual Deployment (Alternative)

If you prefer manual deployment:
```bash
cd epsilon-academy
npm run deploy
```
